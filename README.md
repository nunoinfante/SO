## Assignement:
[First Phase](https://github.com/nunoinfante/SO/tree/master/projeto_1)\
[Second Phase](https://github.com/nunoinfante/SO/tree/master/projeto_2)

## About:
The main goal of this project was to develop a new version of the command grep, with added functionalities such as the option to search using processes or threads (and how many of them). Other functionalities like being able to distribute text files through processes taking into account the size of the files. The project was developed in two phases:
\The first one focused on developing the command pgrepwc (parallel grep with counting), a new version of the command grep with new functionalities and that parallelizes searches.
\The second focused on extending the previous phase with added funcionalities. Such funcionalities include a more equitable division of files between processes and a "special" parallelization where each search block cannot exceed the defined number of bytes.
